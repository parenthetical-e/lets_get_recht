# Let's get Recht.

# Guest lecture 

For CMU - neural and cognitive models of adaptive decisions (CMU 85435)

The slides (as a jupyter notebook) can be found [here](https://github.com/parenthetical-e/lets_get_recht/blob/master/lecture.ipynb). If you clone this repo and run the `.ipynb` locally, the following run from the command line will output nice `.html` slides in your browser.

`jupyter nbconvert Jupyter\ Slides.ipynb --to slides --post serve`

# Lab

I also created a [computational lab]((https://github.com/CoAxLab/AdaptiveDecisionMaking_2018/blob/master/notebooks/Lab%205%20-%20SNUZ.ipynb)) to go with this talk. In it you can compare Recht's augmented random search ([ARS](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.07055)) to Proximal Policy Optimization ([PPO](https://blog.openai.com/openai-baselines-ppo/)), a state of the 'cart' RL method.
